abstract = "This study attempts to investigate the presence of post-event over or under reaction in stock markets of the top ten countries by market-capitalization. An event is defined as an extreme price movement beyond a pre-defined threshold. Intra-day stock returns at ten-minute frequency starting from June 2009 till May 2016 have been analysed using Average cumulative returns (ACR) and Average cumulative abnormal returns (ACAR) for a six-day duration after the event. It seems that there is presence of over/under reaction in eight out of total ten countries and investors display psychological biases which lead to profit making opportunities. Extended Summary: DeBondt and Thaler (1985) found that stock prices tend to show a reversal after periods of extreme movements. This suggests that investors overreact to information and the subsequent reversals are a correction of the initial overreaction. Presence of over and under reaction in financial markets contradicts with the basic premise of market efficiency and implies that abnormal returns can be earned in financial markets. We explore the presence of over or under reaction in top 10 stock markets in the world as per market capitalisation. A reversal in prices post an extreme movement suggests the presence of overreaction bias while a continuation in trend denotes presence of under reaction. Absence of significant abnormal returns after price shocks imply that markets are informationally efficient. To our knowledge, there is no current study on the comparative analysis of over/under reaction in 10 major stock markets, namely USA, UK, Japan, China, Hong Kong, Canada, Germany, India, Switzerland and Australia. Also, this study uses intra-day price data which enables us to better analyse market behaviour in the short term as it is possible that the corrections in the market may last only for a duration of a few minutes or hours. To summarise the results, we find evidence for the presence of over and/or under reaction in all but two of the stock markets (Japan & UK). In some cases, the market corrects the bias within the first few hours of post event trading (China), while in some other cases the correction lasts even up to six days (Switzerland & India). In fact, the behaviour of most markets is different in case of positive and negative shocks. So the market's reaction to a price event is conditional upon the direction of the shock suggesting that investors react differently to negative and positive information."
