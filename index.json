Our objective in this study is to test the robustness of the association between aggregating earnings and real GDP growth across multiple countries and for different definitions of aggregate earnings. We test whether aggregate earnings changes predict future economic growth in eight countries – Australia, Canada, China, India, Japan, South Korea, the UK, and the USA. We find positive evidence regarding the generalisability of the aggregate earnings – real GDP relation in an international context. In additional tests, we find that economic forecasters appear to underreact to aggregate earnings information. Our results show that aggregate earnings lead economic growth and forecasts of real GDP growth can be improved by incorporating aggregate earnings information. Further, we also test if negative earnings changes contain more information than positive earnings changes and find only modest evidence in favour of this hypothesis. The results are robust to alternative statistical methodology and the removal of the USA data from the sample.","tags":[],"title":"Aggregate earnings and gross domestic product: International Evidence","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Vaibhav Lalwani","Udayan Sharma","Madhumita Chakraborty"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1551378600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1551378600,"objectID":"9ea146136fd679afe48c79bb435ae6b4","permalink":"https://vaibhavlalwani.github.io/publication/journal-article-3/","publishdate":"2019-03-01T00:00:00+05:30","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-article-3/","section":"publication","summary":"This study attempts to investigate the presence of post-event over or under reaction in stock markets of the top ten countries by market-capitalization. An event is defined as an extreme price movement beyond a pre-defined threshold. Intra-day stock returns at ten-minute frequency starting from June 2009 till May 2016 have been analysed using Average cumulative returns (ACR) and Average cumulative abnormal returns (ACAR) for a six-day duration after the event. It seems that there is presence of over/under reaction in eight out of total ten countries and investors display psychological biases which lead to profit making opportunities.","tags":[],"title":"Investor reaction to extreme price shocks in stock markets: A cross country examination","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Vaibhav Lalwani","Madhumita Chakraborty"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1535740200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1535740200,"objectID":"966884cc0d8ac9e31fab966c4534e973","permalink":"https://vaibhavlalwani.github.io/publication/journal-article/","publishdate":"2018-09-01T00:00:00+05:30","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-article/","section":"publication","summary":"In this study, We test if seven commonly used asset-pricing factors predict future growth in GDP and industrial production.
